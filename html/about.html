            This map shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate">climate normals</a>,
            such as temperature and precipitation amounts, as colours on the map.

    <h3>Caveats</h3>
    <p>
        The author of this app takes NO responsibility for damages or injuries
        caused by trusting the information presented in the app.
        Errors are absolutely possible and inevitable.

        Historical data here are interpolated from station data from CRU.
        Local data may be based on a weather station or it may not be.
        Check your local government's climate data to be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Projections from the models are calibrated against the historical data
        in order to compare apples to apples. The forecasted normals
        show the projected changes rather than what the models think the
        climate normals are going to be.
        The process was inspired by
        <a href="https://worldclim.org/data/downscaling.html">WorldClim's downscaling algorithm</a>.
