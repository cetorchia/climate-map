            <h3>About Climate Map</h3>
            <p>
                This map shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate">climate normals</a>,
                such as temperature and precipitation amounts, as colours on the map.
                Click anywhere on the map to see charts on local climate data for that location.
                Drag the slider at the bottom to see projections on
                the future climate. You can change the data source and period in
                the hamburger menu on the left. It is recommended you look at multiple
                climate models to take into account all possible scenarios.
                Citations and links to the original data are shown at the bottom of the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Climate is not weather. If the weather is like a person's current mood,
                then the climate is like their personality. This map does NOT show
                the current weather.
            </p>
            <h3>Caveats</h3>
            <p>
                This app is meant as a tool to help you visualize and guide
                your future research on your climate and its changes, empowering you
                to adapt to the changing environment.
                The author of this app takes NO responsibility for damages or injuries
                caused by trusting the information presented in the app.
                Errors are absolutely possible and inevitable.
                CONFIRM all climate data with government agencies, model sources, and
                residents of the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historical data presented here are interpolated from station data.
                Since weather stations are not placed on every inch of the planet,
                these data are approximations and must be taken with a grain of salt.
                Weather stations that do exist may have been omitted and the
                amounts will be interpolations and not observations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Projections from the models are calibrated against the historical data
                in order to compare apples to apples. The forecasted normals
                show the projected changes rather than what the models think the
                climate normals are going to be. In either case a grain of salt must be
                taken with this information.
                See <a href="http://www.worldclim.org/downscaling">WorldClim's downscaling algorithm</a>
                for the ideas behind the calibration process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The projections assume different economic scenarios. It's anyone's guess
                what will actually happen.
                Due to limited capacity, not all climate models are included in the app.
